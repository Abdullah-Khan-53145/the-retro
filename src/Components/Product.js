          "These are highly rated so I thought Id buy them for jogging. Because of foot problems, I usually have to substitute the footbed in the shoe for an orthotic.I tried these on and they look pretty good and feel pretty good. The sole on them is a little harder and more supportive than other shoes, which I like. Unfortunately, I would still need to use an orthotic to jog in these, as the footbed is somewhat flat and not overly arch-supportive. That's not to say they are a bad shoe, quite the opposite, they are really good.So, currently I'm using them as my biking shoe (mountain, road) and they work great for that. Probably a pretty good walking shoe. Not so sure about using them as a true running shoe, depends on your needs for support.",

          "Love these shoes! I bought my husband a pair of these shoes and he loves them and couldn't stop talking about how great they were. Well, I happen to be running to my car and just slipped on his shoes and I have to say, OMG! They felt awesome even though they weren't my size. So, I have to agree with my husband and even tell him he was right for once, lol. So, I bought myself a pair, they fit perfectly, feel great, high quality.",

          "These shoes are very comfortable, but most importantly they are sturdily built. Typically I start wearing a sneaker out within the first month of use, however, in the weeks that I've owned this and after walking several dozen miles in them there's almost no signs of wear or tear. If you are on a budget, buy these.I wouldn't work out in them as they are high soled and you could get a nasty sprain running in these (also kind of heavy).",

          "I got these for a nice looking pair of shoes on the weekends. I have size 14 4E feet. They are comfortable enough to wear around for a day. Over all I am happy with them. I will say though, my feet are wide and it is hard to find a 4E that is still wide enough and actually fits. I'm a Dunham, Brooks, Hoka 4E person. These brands, my little toe does not rub the outside. Asics, Saucony, New Balance, all of those 4E my little toe is still squished against the side. That is the case with these as well. So, if those brands fit you, these will be just fine. If those brands are slightly snug on you, these will be too. The length is spot on. The only other ding i'd give it is as soft and flexible as the sides are, really nice, the big logo on the side is fairly rigid and you can feel it on the side of your foot. Not rubbing to the point of blisters or anything, but you definitely know there's a big logo on the side of your shoe.",

Wouldn't do anything longer than 15k on them, will never brake a personal record on them, but they cost at least half the price of all my other running shoes, which make this pair a pretty good option for daily trainers. Helps you balance out the wear of your other, more expensive, running shoes.",
